Malware Classification on Spark

This was a course project for CSCI 8360 Data Science Practicum at UGA to implement malware classification on nearly 0.5 TB of data. The aim of the project was to implement everything in RDDs in spark and deploy it to Google Cloud dataproc cluster. Spark's MLLIB was used extensively to implement different algorithms namely SVM, Linear regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest.

# How to run

A simple way to run the project is implement below command:
